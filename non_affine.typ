  = Non Affine Transformations
  We have seen above that affine transformations can help with rotation, scaling etc. but is not helpful in actually converting "shapes". This means, that a trapezium cannot be converted into a rectangle and so on. This is because these shapes have a different set of lines which are parallel $dash$ their axes must be transformed/warped.

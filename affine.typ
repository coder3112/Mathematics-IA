  == Rotation
  A rotation matrix $R$ is represented by:
  $
  R = mat(
    cos theta, -sin theta;
    sin theta, cos theta
  )
  $
  However, computing trignometric functions would be incredibly hard. Instead, we will use the dot and cross products, since they incorporate that into nicer vector/matrix algebra.

  *PLEASE NOTE THAT THE REST OF THE MATH WAS SHOWN IN THE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED DRAFT, AND WE DISCUSSED IT IN OUR MEETING. I AM WRITING THE DRAFT IN A NEW DOCUMENT NOW TO INCORPORATE OUR DISCUSSION, WHICH IS WHY THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CONTAIN THAT (YET)*
